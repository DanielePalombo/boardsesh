-- Custom migration generated with drizzle-kit (generate --custom).
-- Contract half of reverting #6339 (#6431 reverted its code, this drops what
-- its migrations left behind). Nothing has read these since #6431's backend
-- went live. This migration drops the two triggers and their functions; the
-- next one (generated from the Drizzle schema) drops the indexes and columns.
--
-- Dropped here, and nothing else:
--   trg_board_climbs_reference_membership ON board_climbs  (0270)
--   sync_board_climb_reference_membership()                (0270)
--   trg_sync_deletion_stream_at ON sync_deletions          (0272)
--   public.stamp_sync_deletion_stream_at()                 (0272)
-- The triggers go first: a function cannot be dropped while a trigger calls
-- it, and stamp_sync_deletion_stream_at() writes the stream_at column the next
-- migration drops. No IF EXISTS and no CASCADE, so a missing object or an
-- unexpected dependant fails the deploy instead of passing quietly.
--
-- Not dropped: public.sync_deletions_safe_cutoff(double precision) and the role
-- boardsesh_sync_cutoff_owner. An administrator installed both outside any
-- migration, the migration login cannot drop them, and 0272 still needs them
-- to replay on a fresh database. packages/db/scripts/teardown-sync-deletions-cutoff.ts
-- removes them from production after this lands (docs/sync-deletions-cutoff.md).
--
-- Locks. DROP TRIGGER takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on its table, and the next
-- migration's DROP INDEX and DROP COLUMN take it on sync_deletions. Every climb
-- page and sync pull reads board_climbs, and every delete on a synced table
-- writes sync_deletions, so a bare DROP TRIGGER would queue behind one long
-- reader and then block everything behind itself. Take both locks up front in
-- one retry-protected step, the 0144/0220/0250 shape. The drops themselves are
-- catalogue-only and finish in milliseconds, and the deploy runs every pending
-- migration in one transaction, so the locks are released at its commit.
