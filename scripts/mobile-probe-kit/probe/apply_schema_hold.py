"""Keep a probe build from migrating the phone's offline database. See docs/mobile-visible-performance.md.

    apply_schema_hold.py <repo-root>

Installing a build that knows a newer on-device migration migrates the tester's
real database, and their store build then refuses the file until that migration
ships (the downgrade rule in docs/offline-sync-plan.md). Check first:
`schema_check.py` prints the phone's version next to the checkout's.

This holds the build at version 12. It leaves out migration 13, which only adds
`idx_stats_ascents`, and points the climb list's ranked walk at the same index
under a probe-only name. Create that index once on the phone if it is missing
(the first #6313 measurement did, as `idx_stats_ascents_probe`); without it the
default climb list fails to load.

Delete this script once the store build knows version 13, and write its
successor for the next migration: what to leave out, and what stands in for it.
